# Financial-Data-Forecasting

## Objective 
To design and develop the best model for the financial data, the daily historical Apple stock prices (open, high, low, close and adjusted prices).

## Conclusion 
GARCH (2,2), GARCH(1,1) with normally distributed errors, GARCH(1,1) model with t-distribution, GARCH(1,1) model with skewed t-distribution, eGARCH(1,1) model with t-distribution, fGARCH(1,1) model with t-distribution, and iGARCH (1,1) model with normal distribution are applied to fit the data from the daily historical Apple stock prices(open, high, low, close and adjusted prices) from February 1, 2002 to January 31, 2017.     
To sum up, the eGARCH (1,1) model with t-distribution is selected for the most appropriate model to fit and predict trend in the apple stock prices over the past 15 years.
